                                      <h2>Tangible and Embodied Interaction<br/></h2>
                                      <h3>Augmented Reality & Dissection</h3>
                                      <p> 
                                          This project intended to research augmented reality used for anatomy teaching. 
                                          We intended to use a combination of existing augmented reality software with support for handheld 
                                          devices. Furthermore we created prototypes of simple anatomy models for the 
                                          physical counterpart of the virtual models. The models were equipped with simple sensors for 
                                          determining the state of the model, for instance picking apart the chest cavity in order to render 
                                          the visuals accordingly. The wizard of oz technique was used as well for simulating 
                                          interaction with the artifact that is not possible to prototype within the given timeframe.
                                      </p>
                                      <br>
                                    </header>
                                        <h3> What we started with</h3>
                                       <p> The aim of this case study is to implement AR into the dissection aspect since dissection at times could be deemed as 
                                          an  unideal  experience  for  students.  Utilizing  AR  could  present  the  idea  of  dissection  gradually  and  minimize  bad 
                                          experiences for students. An example would be that the reaction to smell and blood would be non-existent when using 
                                          AR, however the students would still acquire the same knowledge.
                                          Therefore multiple pitch sketches were created in order to mediate how and what we could do in order to eliminate the problems
                                          students might experience while dissecting real animals while learning biology.
                                       </p>

                                      <h3> How we moved forward</h3>
                                      <p> We created a Look & Feel prototype which was supposed to test the tangible part of the user interaction with the system. The following 
                                          hypotheses  was tested  here:  the  "grossness"  and  disgust  experienced  when  dissecting  a  real  heart  is  what  makes  an 
                                          experience memorable, there is a way to mimic a real dissection without sacrificing an anatomical accuracy. The overall 
                                          appearance of the heart will be considered, that includes texture, material, and other liquids, and filter those qualities 
                                          of the prototype.
                                          The first component of this look and feel prototype consists of a heart. 
                                          We were using a Halloween decoration for the first experiment. 
                                          The heart used was as anatomically accurate as we could find. 
                                          Although there is an advantage in customizing the heart and choosing the material ourselves, however due
                                          time limitations we were forced to go with a common Halloween dectoration in order to rapidly start the user-testing phases.
                                      </p>
                                      <h4>Iteration on the Heart prototype</h4>
                                      <p>
                                       After testing with various liquids like oils and dish soap, we discovered that the hearts surface was porous 
                                       therefore any substance we poured on it would get absorbed after a few minutes.  
                                       This led us to use the plastic Halloween decoration as a cast for a new heart. 
                                       The material we used to create a new heart is candle gel. 
                                       This would make the heat more jelly, like a real heart would be. 
                                       Furthermore, this new material would not dissolve or absorb any liquid that we would pour onto it. 
                                       Another advantage of this material is that it could be re-melted and reused multiple times. 
                                       While using the heart for user-testing dish soap was poured onto it to mimic blood. 
                                      </p>
                                      <a href="" class="image fit"><image src="images/Iteration1.png"/></a>
                                      <br>
                                      <h4>Implementation Prototype</h4>
                                      <p> 
                                          The  implementation prototype tests how the AR app performs alongside the model.
                                           Ideally, the application  would recognize a dissected or cut heart to show the user how the ventricles 
                                           and atriums contract, the valves open and close, and the blood flow. To reproduce that experience, 
                                           we decided to use Blippar, a free AR application that offers users the possibility to create their own 
                                           AR experience and test it in the application. For the application to recognize the open 
                                           heart and display the information and animation on it, a marker was placed inside of it so that, 
                                           when cut in half, this marker would reveal itself. 
                                      </p>
                                      <a href="" class="image fit"><image src="images/implementationprototype.png"/></a>
                                      <br>
                                      <h3> Conclusion</h3>
                                      <p>
                                      To conclude, it could be beneficial to use AR with other forms of learning, 
                                      compared to entirely textbooks or computer-based material. 
                                      AR also provides the possibility to learn through embodied interactions, 
                                      which means that users can improve their skills by conducting physical tasks with greater precision. 
                                      Learning through AR is at times unsuccessful, in relation to it being the perfect medium for all students. 
                                      Visualization and touch combined with AR offers other means for the students to not only obtain but maintain knowledge. 
                                      </p>

                            <h2>Service Design</h2>
                            <h3>In collaboration with Malmö Civic Lab & Förskoleförvaltningen</h3>
                            <p>This project was conducted in collaboration with Malmö Civic Lab in order to provide them with a way to improve Förskoleförvaltningens Onboarding process.
                                Our goals for this project was to allow the process of introducing new employees to become more efficient and less cumbersome 
                                for everyone involved. We also wanted to provide the right information and equipment for the newly employed at the right time.
                                And finally we wanted to create an easier and faster way, for the newly employed to becoming part of the workplace based team 
                                and allow them to feel equal to their colleagues. Due to confidential information, I will not be able to provide all details 
                                regarding the project. However, I am able to provide sketches, userjourneys, and prototypes, etc.</p>
                            <h3>What we started with</h3>
                                <p>In order to find the problematic aspects of any unboarding process, we created a userjourney and a service map which provided us with a baseknowledge of 
                                    how their system works today. This was conducted in order to know what aspects we could improve.
                                    The userjourney was conducted through multiple interviews with both employees, and employers.
                                Due to Covid-19 we were not able to conduct any fieldwork during this project.</p>
                                <a href="" class="image fit"> <image src="images/servicemap.png"/></a>
                                <br>
                            <h4>Next step</h4>
                            <p>
                                The next step was to identify the different stakeholders and the new employee interacts with in some shape or form during the introduction phase. 
                                The stakeholder map also includes the different touchpoints which are utilized during the different interactions. 
                                Pretty quickly we were able to see that the constant back and forth between the newly employed and all the different stakeholders was 
                                most certainly affecting the whole introduction process and forcing it to become dragged out since most departments have other work tasks they need to
                                complete. Some of the issues were lack of phones, keys, and clothes which are crucial for the new employees. </p>
                                <a href="" class="image fit"> <image src="images/stakeholdermap.png"/></a>
                                <br>
                            <h4>Identifying areas of improvement</h4>
                            <p> Through interviews and digital observation we were able to see that the employees were missing out on crutial information which was posted on their web-based system called Komin.
                                This was due to poor design, as most of the information was spread out and had no logical flow while browsing the web page. 
                                Due to obvious reasons I am not able to show previous versions of their system. However, by improving Komin and re-designing the layout, the participants were able to find information
                                easier and quicker which could improve the onboarding process.
                               </p>
                            <p>Another aspect which was lacking, was the aspect of ordering phones for new employees. 
                                A phone is crucial for newly employed since they use it to take attendence on the children when they arrive or leave the preschool.
                                Therefore a new system was developed which only relys on one person, the vice principal, to order a new phone once the new employee has signed the 
                                employment contract. The IT department is then notified and is able to change the status directly once the phone has been sent out.
                            </p>
